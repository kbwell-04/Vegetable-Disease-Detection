Here's a simple but well-structured `README.md` for your **Vegetable Disease Detection** project. You can copy and paste this into a file named `README.md` and place it in your project root.

# 🌿 Vegetable Disease Detection Using AI

This project is an AI-powered system for detecting diseases in vegetable plants like tomato, potato, and green pepper using a machine learning model integrated into a Flutter Android app.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 Detects diseases from leaf images.
- 📱 Android app built with Flutter.
- 🤖 On-device inference using a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model.
- 💊 Recommends treatment and prevention for each detected disease.
- 🖼️ Supports image upload and real-time photo capture.

## 🧠 Model

- Trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Based on the **MobileNetV2** architecture.
- Dataset from **Kaggle** (PlantVillage).
- Converted to `.tflite` format for mobile deployment.
- Accuracy: **94.2%** on validation data.

## 📸 Screenshots

_Add screenshots of the app interface here if available._

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Flutter SDK
- TensorFlow Lite
- Android Studio or VS Code
- A physical or virtual Android device

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User selects or captures an image of a vegetable leaf.
2. The image is passed to the TFLite model.
3. The model predicts the disease class.
4. The app shows the result with:
   - Disease name
   - Cure and prevention tips

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kbwell-04/Vegetable-Disease-Detection.git
cd Vegetable-Disease-Detection

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Android
flutter run
